## 🏙️ About the Project

This project was created as part of the **Scrimba FullStack Career Path**.
It’s a simple landing page that highlights my **hometown, Londrina (Brazil)** — a city known for its coffee fields and modern lifestyle.

I followed a **Figma design** provided in the course and recreated it entirely from scratch using **pure HTML and CSS**.
My main goal with this project was to **strengthen my frontend fundamentals**, focusing on clean structure, alignment, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

---

## 💡 What I Learned

* Writing clean and semantic HTML
* Using **Flexbox** for layouts and alignment
* Applying background images and visual effects (box-shadow, hover, etc.)
* Reproducing layouts accurately from **Figma designs**
* Organizing CSS with clarity and reusability
* Deploying a static site on **Netlify**

---

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I’m currently revisiting the **core foundations of web development** — starting from **HTML and CSS** — before diving deeper into **JavaScript, TypeScript, and fullstack development**.

This project is part of my journey to rebuild strong technical fundamentals with consistency and attention to detail.

If you’d like to **give feedback or a quick code review**, please feel free to do so.
I’d love to hear your thoughts and suggestions! 🙌
